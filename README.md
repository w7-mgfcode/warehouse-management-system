# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

A comprehensive web-based warehouse management system designed for pallet racking warehouses with support for food products requiring strict date tracking and FEFO (First Expired, First Out) inventory management.

## Features

### Completed (Phase 1, 2, 3 & 4)

**Phase 1 - Foundation**
- ✅ JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, manager, warehouse, viewer)
- ✅ Warehouses CRUD with customizable bin structure templates
- ✅ Hungarian localization for all user-facing messages

**Phase 2 - Master Data & Storage**
- ✅ Products CRUD with SKU validation and category filtering
- ✅ Suppliers CRUD with Hungarian tax number validation
- ✅ Bins CRUD with warehouse filtering and status management
- ✅ Bulk bin generation from range specifications (e.g., 3×10×5×4 = 600 bins)

**Phase 3 - Inventory Operations & FEFO**
- ✅ Inventory receipt with batch tracking and expiry dates
- ✅ Inventory issue with FEFO (First Expired, First Out) enforcement
- ✅ FEFO algorithm with 3-level sort priority for food safety
- ✅ Movement audit trail (immutable history of all transactions)
- ✅ Expiry warnings with 4 urgency levels (critical < 7 days)
- ✅ Stock reports (levels, locations, summaries)

**Phase 4 - Advanced Operations & Automation**
- ✅ Stock reservations with FEFO allocation for customer orders
- ✅ Same-warehouse transfers between bins
- ✅ Cross-warehouse transfers with dispatch/confirm workflow
- ✅ Celery background jobs for automated maintenance
- ✅ Hungarian email alerts for expiring products
- ✅ Job monitoring and manual trigger capabilities

**Test Coverage**: 154 backend + 35+ frontend = **189+ total tests** (100% Phase 1-6 coverage)

### Completed (Phase 5)

### Completed (Phase 6)
- ✅ **Phase 6: Testing, Quality Assurance & DevOps** - 100% Complete! 🎉

  - ✅ Phase 6B: Frontend Unit Testing (Vitest - 15+ tests, 70% coverage)
  - ✅ Phase 6C: Production Docker Setup (multi-stage builds, non-root, health checks)
  - ✅ Phase 6D: CI/CD Pipeline (3-job pipeline: backend, frontend, E2E)
  - ✅ Phase 6E: Backend Enhancements (Prometheus metrics, structured logging, rate limiting, 8 integration tests)
  - ✅ Phase 6F: Documentation & Scripts (4 comprehensive guides, 4 production scripts)

## Repo Governance (Agents + Workflow)

This repo is designed to be worked on by both humans and AI assistants.

- Agent roles and boundaries: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- Global rules / merge gates: [specs/global-rules.md](specs/global-rules.md)
- Copilot (GitHub Ops) operating rules: [specs/copilot-instructions.md](specs/copilot-instructions.md)
- GitHub workflow conventions: [Docs/GitHub_Workflow.md](Docs/GitHub_Workflow.md)

## CI & Testing Notes

- CI workflow definition: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- CI runs in the backend working directory and provisions Postgres 17.
- Tests default to in-memory SQLite locally; CI forces Postgres by setting `TEST_DATABASE_URL`.

Backend CI checks (run from `w7-WHv1/backend`):

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
mypy .  # advisory in CI for now
```
