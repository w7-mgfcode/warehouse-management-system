# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

A comprehensive web-based warehouse management system designed for pallet racking warehouses with support for food products requiring strict date tracking and FEFO (First Expired, First Out) inventory management.

## Features

### Completed (Phase 1, 2, 3 & 4)

**Phase 1 - Foundation**
- ✅ JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, manager, warehouse, viewer)
- ✅ Warehouses CRUD with customizable bin structure templates
- ✅ Hungarian localization for all user-facing messages

**Phase 2 - Master Data & Storage**
- ✅ Products CRUD with SKU validation and category filtering
- ✅ Suppliers CRUD with Hungarian tax number validation
- ✅ Bins CRUD with warehouse filtering and status management
- ✅ Bulk bin generation from range specifications (e.g., 3×10×5×4 = 600 bins)

**Phase 3 - Inventory Operations & FEFO**
- ✅ Inventory receipt with batch tracking and expiry dates
- ✅ Inventory issue with FEFO (First Expired, First Out) enforcement
- ✅ FEFO algorithm with 3-level sort priority for food safety
- ✅ Movement audit trail (immutable history of all transactions)
- ✅ Expiry warnings with 4 urgency levels (critical < 7 days)
- ✅ Stock reports (levels, locations, summaries)

**Phase 4 - Advanced Operations & Automation**
- ✅ Stock reservations with FEFO allocation for customer orders
- ✅ Same-warehouse transfers between bins
- ✅ Cross-warehouse transfers with dispatch/confirm workflow
- ✅ Celery background jobs for automated maintenance
- ✅ Hungarian email alerts for expiring products
- ✅ Job monitoring and manual trigger capabilities

**Test Coverage**: 140 tests passing (Phase 1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

### Planned (Phase 5+)
- 🔄 Phase 5: Frontend (React 19 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui)

## Technology Stack

**Backend**: Python 3.13+, FastAPI 0.125.0, SQLAlchemy 2.0.45, PostgreSQL 17, Valkey 8.1
**Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS 4.0, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query 5.90+, Zustand 5.x
**Testing**: pytest with 92 passing tests (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
**Code Quality**: ruff (linting + formatting), mypy (type checking)

## Quick Start

See [w7-WHv1/README.md](w7-WHv1/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

```bash
# Clone and start services
cd w7-WHv1
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations and seed data
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed

# Access API
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Repo Governance (Agents + Workflow)

This repo is designed to be worked on by both humans and AI assistants.

- Agent roles and boundaries: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- Global rules / merge gates: [specs/global-rules.md](specs/global-rules.md)
- Copilot (GitHub Ops) operating rules: [specs/copilot-instructions.md](specs/copilot-instructions.md)
- GitHub workflow conventions: [Docs/GitHub_Workflow.md](Docs/GitHub_Workflow.md)

## CI & Testing Notes

- CI workflow definition: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- CI runs in the backend working directory and provisions Postgres 17.
- Tests default to in-memory SQLite locally; CI forces Postgres by setting `TEST_DATABASE_URL`.

Backend CI checks (run from `w7-WHv1/backend`):

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
mypy .  # advisory in CI for now
```
